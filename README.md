Data on aging on burying beetles

In my undergrad I performed a 6 month project on burying beetle aging.

This was really cool and my first exprince of any coding.

I'd hoped that it would get published one day, but its been a number of years.

I'd really like to go over this work to see what I've learned. lookign back on it the data flow and analysis seems a mess. Planning to re-organise and make it usable for others (and myself!).

I also think its a really good basic data set for anyone learning survival analysis.
