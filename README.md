Data on aging on burying beetles

In my undergrad I perfomed a 6 month project on burying beetle aging.

this was really cool and my first exprince of any coding.

I'd hoped that it would get published one day, but its been a number of years.

I'd really like to go over this work to see what I've learned.

I also think its a really good basic data sey for anyone learning survival analysis.
